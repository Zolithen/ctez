/* Text_buffer stores text in 2 different buffers: one that consists of text before the cursor
and one that consists of text after the cursor. This is pretty handy for modifying lots of characters around
a position (for example, the cursor) Fields that talk about chars are about the unicode
UTF-16 type (2 bytes) instead of the standard 1 byte. Windows' default console font doesn't even have unicode
characters over FFFF so it's probably not worth it to have full unicode support bcs I'm probably not gonna
use it.
A text like abcd|efg where | is the cursor may be stored in these buffers like:
                    p
before_cursor = abcd···
after_cursor  = ····efg
                   p*/
